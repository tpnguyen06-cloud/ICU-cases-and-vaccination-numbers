# ICU-cases-and-vaccination-numbers
Ontario is the province that has the highest number of confirmed cases among Canada. As of February 1st, 2022, this province has the number of cases as one third of total cases in Canada with more than 1 million cases, followed by Quebec and Alberta. (Statista, 2022). In Spring 2021, the third wave of the pandemic peaked again in Canada and impacted the health care system through August 2021. 

The capacity of acute care as well as intensive care unit in many hospital were overwhelmed. 
The objective of this project was to determine the relationship between ICU current cases among Ontario hospitals and the number of fully vaccinated people during the third wave of COVID-19. Having a knowledge about the relationship might help with the prediction in ICU capacity in the future with the vaccination factor. 

This study will answer the following research question:

** Can a polynomial regression accurately predict the future ICU cases given the number of people got vaccinated?
